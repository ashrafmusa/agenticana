## 🔜 Next Phases (Open for Contributors)

### P26: Voice-to-Code Bridge (Real)

**Status:** 🟡 Open
**Idea:** Wire the existing `nl_swarm.py` to a microphone input via `speechrecognition` or `whisper.cpp`. Speak your task → instant agent dispatch.
**Good for:** Python developer with audio/ML interest
[Start a Discussion →](https://github.com/ashrafmusa/agenticana/discussions/new)

### P27: Agenticana Plugin Marketplace

**Status:** 🟡 Idea
**Idea:** Extend the Agent Exchange so community members can publish, version, and install custom agents via a registry (like npm for agents).
**Good for:** Fullstack developer
[Start a Discussion →](https://github.com/ashrafmusa/agenticana/discussions/new)

### P28: Agenticana-as-a-Service (Hosted)

**Status:** 🚀 Future
**Idea:** Cloud-hosted Agenticana instance so teams without local Python/Node setup can still use the Swarm, Guardian, and Sovereign Loop via a web UI.

## 💡 Good First Issues for New Contributors

These don't require deep knowledge — just attention to detail:

- [ ] **Add 10 more ReasoningBank decisions** from your own dev experience
- [ ] **Add NL Swarm keywords** for `mobile`, `machine-learning`, `game-dev` domains
- [ ] **Improve agent anti-patterns** — add 3 more "never do this" rules to any agent
- [ ] **Write a usage example** for a phase you've tried
- [ ] **Translate a script's comments** to be clearer for non-native English speakers
- [ ] **Add a new issue template** for a use case not covered

## [6.0.0] — 2026-03-03 🦅 Secretary Bird Edition

### The Differentiators — Phases P15–P19

> *"We don't react. We stomp, record, and move forward with proof."*
> Agenticana becomes the first AI developer system to prove its work.

#### Added — P15: Real LLM Simulacrum
- `scripts/real_simulacrum.py` — Each agent (backend-specialist, security-auditor, etc.) calls a real Gemini API instance with a domain-specific system prompt
- Agents genuinely debate architecture with opposing LLM opinions — not hardcoded responses
- Graceful fallback to persona mode when no API key is set
- `--set-key` flag to save Gemini key to `.Agentica/gemini.key`

#### Added — P16: Guardian Mode
- `scripts/guardian_mode.py` — Git pre-commit hook that intercepts every commit
- **Check 1:** Sentinel audit (advisory — warns but does not block)
- **Check 2:** Python syntax lint (blocking on error)
- **Check 3:** Smart secret scan — detects real hardcoded secret values (len >20, not placeholder), not variable names
- `guardian_mode.py install / remove / audit / status`
- Logs every audit to `.Agentica/logs/guardian/`

#### Added — P17: Natural Language Swarm
- `scripts/nl_swarm.py` — Type plain English, get a swarm manifest
- Keyword-based agent selection (22 trigger groups across 8 agents)
- Intent detection: build / audit / test / deploy / optimise / document / debug / review
- `--run` flag to immediately dispatch the generated swarm
- `--shadow` flag for sandboxed execution

#### Added — P18: ADR Generator
- `scripts/adr_generator.py` — Converts Simulacrum session JSON into professional Architecture Decision Records
- Saved to `docs/decisions/ADR-XXX-topic-slug.md`
- Auto-numbered, includes vote tally, winning proposal, all constraints
- `--latest` / `--list` / `--all` flags

#### Added — P19: Proof-of-Work Commits
- `scripts/pow_commit.py` — Signs every commit with a cryptographic attestation
- Attestation proves: debate completed, performance benchmarked, guardian passed
- Trust Score: 0–100 — CERTIFIED (≥70) / PARTIAL (≥40) / UNVERIFIED (<40)
- Stored in `.Agentica/attestations/attest_<hash>_<ts>.json`
- `pow_commit.py sign / verify / log`

#### Changed
- **Mascot:** Secretary Bird 🦅 replaces all lobster references (8 files purged)
- `README.md` fully rewritten for v6.0 with P1–P19 phase table
- Competitor table updated to include OpenClaw comparison
- `scripts/rebrand_secretary_bird.py` — migration utility (can be run again if needed)
- Zero lobster emoji or text remain in codebase (verified via grep)

## [5.0.0] — 2026-03-03

### Phases P12–P14 + MCP Fix

#### Added — P12: Logic Simulacrum
- `scripts/simulacrum.py` — 5-phase debate engine (opening → debate → proposal → vote → consensus)
- 7 built-in agent personas with distinct domain biases
- `quick_debate()` function for auto-agent selection based on topic keywords
- Session logs saved to `.Agentica/logs/simulacrum/session_<id>.json`

#### Added — P13: Performance Pulse
- `scripts/performance_pulse.py` — Benchmarks 4 core Agenticana scripts × 3 runs each
- Reports avg_time_ms, peak_memory_mb, status (OPTIMAL / WARN / ERROR)
- Configurable thresholds. Results saved to `.Agentica/logs/performance/pulse_<ts>.json`

#### Added — P14: Agentica CLI v2
- `scripts/agentica_cli.py` — Unified command interface for all Agenticana tools
- Commands: `swarm`, `sentinel`, `dashboard`, `bridge`, `simulacrum`, `pulse`, `sandbox`, `heartbeat`, `exchange`
- ASCII Secretary Bird header art, no third-party deps, Windows UTF-8 safe

#### Fixed
- MCP Server `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`: resolved by running `npm install` in `mcp/`
- Windows `UnicodeEncodeError` in simulacrum.py: UTF-8 stdout wrapper added
- Recursive sandbox clone: removed `sandbox_manager.py init` from performance benchmarks
